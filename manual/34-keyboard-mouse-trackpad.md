# Keyboard, Mouse, Trackpad

Hyprland lets you configure all your inputs in great detail. You can change the keyboard repeat to be supersonically fast or make the trackpad use natural scrolling. You change all of it in `~/.config/hypr/input.lua`, which you can also reach via _Setup > Input_ in the Omarchy menu (`Super + Space`). Anything you set there replaces Omarchy's defaults.

Here's an example:

```lua
hl.config({
  input = {
    -- Use multiple keyboard layouts and switch between them with Left Alt + Right Alt
    kb_layout = "us,dk",
    kb_options = "compose:caps,shift:both_capslock_cancel,grp:alts_toggle",

    -- Change speed of keyboard repeat
    repeat_rate = 40,
    repeat_delay = 600,

    -- Increase sensitivity for mouse/trackpad (default: 0)
    sensitivity = 0.35,

    touchpad = {
      -- Use natural (inverse) scrolling
      natural_scroll = true,

      -- Use two-finger clicks for right-click instead of lower-right corner
      clickfinger_behavior = true,

      -- Control the speed of your scrolling
      scroll_factor = 0.3,
    },
  },
})

-- Scroll faster in the terminal
o.window("(Alacritty|kitty|foot)", { scroll_touchpad = 1.5 })
```

You can [see all the input options](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Basics/Variables/#input) on the Hyprland wiki for inputs.

By default, Omarchy uses CapsLock as the compose key for [quick emojis](07-hotkeys.md#quick-emojis) and [other completions](07-hotkeys.md#quick-completions). If you'd rather use CapsLock as Caps Lock, move the compose key elsewhere by changing `compose:caps` in `kb_options`. For example, this moves the compose key to Right Alt:

```lua
hl.config({
  input = {
    kb_options = "compose:ralt",
  },
})
```

### Apple keyboard and trackpad defaults

On an Apple keyboard, Command is the `Super` key used throughout this manual. The top row behaves as it does in macOS: press a key by itself for its media function, or hold `Fn` to send F1-F12. Omarchy binds its Mac-specific capture shortcuts to both forms, so `Fn` is optional for those combinations.

The Mac-specific brightness and capture combinations are listed in [Hotkeys](07-hotkeys.md).

Apple trackpads default to natural scrolling and physical clicks instead of tap-to-click. Override either in `~/.config/hypr/input.lua` using the options shown above.

### Trackpad gestures

You can also turn on [touchpad gestures](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Advanced-and-Cool/Gestures/), like swiping with three fingers to change workspaces:

```lua
hl.gesture({ fingers = 3, direction = "horizontal", action = "workspace" })
```

On Dell XPS laptops with a haptic touchpad, you can also set the click strength to low, mid, or high under _Trigger > Hardware > Touchpad Haptics_.

### Keyboard backlight

Laptops with a keyboard backlight LED and an ambient light sensor light the keys in the dark and dim them as the room brightens. Dedicated keyboard-brightness keys still set the level by hand; on Apple keyboards, `Shift + Brightness Up/Down` does that instead. Automatic control resumes when the ambient light changes enough that the old choice no longer fits. Automatic control pauses while the screen is locked or the lid is closed.

### Typing in Chinese, Japanese, and other languages

Omarchy runs the [fcitx5](https://fcitx-im.org/) input method framework as part of every session — it's what powers the CapsLock compose sequences. That means the plumbing for non-Latin input is already in place: install an input engine like `fcitx5-mozc` (Japanese) or `fcitx5-chinese-addons` (Chinese) with `omarchy pkg add`, plus `fcitx5-configtool` to add the engine to your input methods and set the key that switches between them.

### Use ALT as SUPER

On some keyboards, it's not convenient to use the primary meta key (Windows/cmd key) as SUPER. You can change this to be ALT instead using this change:

```lua
hl.config({
  input = {
    kb_options = "compose:caps,shift:both_capslock_cancel,altwin:swap_alt_win",
  },
})
```
