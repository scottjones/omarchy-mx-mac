# The Broadcom firmware on Apple Silicon Macs wedges across s2idle: scans fail
# with -52 and every association is rejected with status_code=16, which
# NetworkManager reports as a wrong password. Toggling the radio does not reset
# the chip firmware - only a driver reload clears it.
# Upstream: https://github.com/AsahiLinux/linux/issues/439
#
# Recover with omarchy-wifi-resume-fix from a service ordered after
# suspend.target, so it runs on resume without delaying it (a system-sleep
# hook would run synchronously and block every resume). The command reloads
# the driver when the wedge signature appears, or when Wi-Fi stays down past a
# short backstop, so it stays a no-op on machines and kernels where the
# firmware bug does not bite - and stops acting early by itself if the bug is
# ever fixed.
#
# BCM4378 (14e4:4425) and BCM4387 (14e4:4433) also appear in T2 Intel Macs,
# where suspend takes a different path - hence the architecture gate.
#
# BCM4388 (14e4:4434) in M2 Max/Ultra Macs is deliberately absent, not an
# oversight: one rode out a six-minute s2idle with zero ASSOC-REJECT
# status_code=16 events and zero scan -52 errors (verified on an M2 Max in
# the PR #255 review), so its firmware does not wedge.
