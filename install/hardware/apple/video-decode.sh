# Hardware video decode on Apple Silicon needs two packages that no repository
# outside omarchy-aarch64 carries.
#
# The kernel already has the driver: CONFIG_VIDEO_APPLE_AVD=m, and it autoloads
# and autoprobes on its own. What it does not have is firmware. Asahi wrote a
# clean MIT-licensed replacement for the Apple Video Decoder rather than
# extracting Apple's, but nobody packaged it, so every boot on a stock install
# ends with the driver giving up:
#
#   avd 269080000.avd: Direct firmware load for apple/avd-fw-v2-t0.bin failed with error -2
#   avd 269080000.avd: probe with driver avd failed with error -2
#
# avd-fw supplies that blob and the decoder appears as /dev/video1.
#
# Firmware alone is not enough to be useful. AVD is a *stateless* decoder,
# which almost nothing on the desktop speaks -- ffmpeg's v4l2m2m decoders are
# stateful and will never negotiate with it. libva-v4l2_request-avd is the
# VA-API translation layer that bridges the two, and it installs itself as
# asahi_drv_video.so, which is the name libva derives from the DRM render node
# here, so applications find the decoder with no environment variable set.
#
# What this buys: about 84% less CPU time spent decoding. The power saving is
# real but modest -- roughly 0.2 W off a machine drawing about 7.8 W during
# playback. mpv, ffmpeg and GStreamer benefit; Chromium on Arch Linux ARM has
# VA-API compiled out of the build, so it cannot use this today.
#
# The decoder only probes at boot, so nothing here rebinds it: the reboot that
# follows setup is what brings it up. The migration that reuses this leaf on an
# existing install asks for that reboot, which is what the changed flag is for.
