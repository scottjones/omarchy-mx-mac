# Sound on Apple Silicon needs three things this install would otherwise never
# get, for three different reasons.
#
# PipeWire's PulseAudio server: install/omarchy-other.packages lists
# pipewire-pulse and says why it is not in the base set -- "Utilized by ISO
# builder to ensure package availability in the ISO". x86 machines get it from
# the ISO. A Mac has no ISO, and wireplumber pulls in pipewire but not
# pipewire-pulse, so the machine ends up with a running audio server that
# nothing can talk to: pactl says "Connection refused", and every Omarchy audio
# command exits 1 -- the volume and mute keys do nothing while brightness works
# fine, because brightness never touches PulseAudio.
#
# Realtime scheduling: rtkit is only an optional dependency of pipewire, so
# nothing here would pull it in. Without it pipewire's data threads run at
# normal priority, and any load spike delays the DSP cycle long enough to
# underrun -- heard as crackling or popping that gets worse under load. The
# Asahi speaker filter chain runs several convolvers per cycle, so it is more
# exposed to this than a plain sink.
#
# Then the Apple parts: asahi-audio carries the UCM profiles and the DSP filter
# chain that makes a speaker sink exist at all, and speakersafetyd is what
# allows the speakers to play. Without the daemon the kernel keeps them muted,
# on purpose -- these drivers can be damaged by what the hardware will happily
# ask them to do.
